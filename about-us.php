            <p style="padding-top: 1rem;">Founded in 2021. Laura started the business from her home in Ontario, Canada. As a tea enthusiast, she realized it was difficult to find and purchase good quality products.

She hoped to build a business where people can learn about benefits of tea and the many tasty ways to prepare it. </p>
